                <h5>Regionals Weekend</h5><p>2/21/2015</p>
                <article>Our Regionals Championship started off great by getting out of school on Friday to drive down to San Antonio for setup, inspections, and judging. We arrived with a good 4 hours to set up before judging, and by 7 o'clock we had finished up for the night! If only getting food after that had been as easy as preparing for competition... funnily enough, none of the restaurants in town were too excited to feed 60 hungry teenagers. Nevertheless, we finally were fed and well(ish) rested for competition the next day. We started Saturday off great by scoring a 533 with our alliance partner, keeping within the 500-600's all of qualifications. We ended up undefeated and 2nd due to RP points, picking High PHidelity and Orobourus as partners. We made it to what we called "Murphy's Finals" because everything that could go wrong, did. During the first match, we disconected and despooled one of our pulleys in the process. We had to call a timeout, and our oponents (Dark Horse, Chrome, and Philobots) showed amazing gracious professionalism by using their timeout as well. The next two rounds, Chrome lost their battery, one of Dark Horse's driver cut his hand open, and our wiring got messed up from our time disconnected earlier. We emerged from probably the most eventful Division Finals ever victorious, and went up against Stryke and the Elemonators in the Event Finals. We won the event, throughout having 5 matches over 700 points! We were super close to setting a new world record, but were really proud of our success. Afterwards, during awards, we watched an amazing performance of the interpreter for the Texas School for the Deaf sign out It's All About That Bass, which was entertaining to watch. We got 2nd Place Inspire, and our very own Lizzy Patterson was nominated as a semi-finalist for the Dean's List Award! At the end of the day, we had qualified for Super Regionals, along with sister teams Stryke and Orobourus. We're sad to see Viperbots Big Fang Fury, Snakebyte, and Venoms' seasons end, but are super excited for the 3 teams that qualified, and can't wait to see everybody at Super Regionals in 3 weeks!</article>

                <h5>Special Olympics and Team Bonding</h5><p>2/7/2015</p>
                <article>This weekend, QUADX continued the tradition of volunteering at the Texas Special Olympics (SOTX). For a couple hours, we helped people with special needs in their bowling competition, making sure they got up to bowl their turn and cheering them on. After two great games, the bowlers were done and had their awards ceremony. We always love volunteering at the Special Olympics, because everyone has a ton of fun- the bowlers and the volunteers alike! Once the event was over, we headed out to Hopdoddy's, probably the best burger place in town. We had to wait a whole hour in line for these amazing burgers, but we spent it all hanging out and talking. After we'd died and gone to heaven eaten, we all headed over to Tyler's house for some more team bonding. We hung out, and watched one of the best movies ever- Monty Python and the Holy Grail. With competition coming up soon, it was really nice to spend a day volunteering and just relaxing as a team and as a group of friends!</article>

                <h5>Harlandale Double Qualifier</h5><p>1/31/2015</p>
                 <article>Our second qualifier of the season, we were back out in San Antonio at Harlandale High School. Having already qualified, we saw this as a great opportunity to test out our new robot and make some new friends! It turns out we would have plenty of time to do so, as the high school we were out experienced power outages for the first 3 hours. During that time, we hung out with other FTC teams, and even got to explain how we built the robot to many FLL teams that were competiting this weekend as well. When Qualifications began, we found some minor issues with our robot, but we were happy for them to arise- now we know what to fix before Regionals. We were 1st Captain, and chose the Shambots and Blackout Enigma as our alliance partners. With such a great alliance, we won the competition! We also won the Think Award and 2nd Place Inspire, and within the other division, our sister team 6210 Viperbots Stryke won 1st Place Inspire and Winning Alliance 1st pick, thus qualifying for Regionals! We're super proud of both our accomplishments and those of all the teams that were there. Hope to see everyone at Regionals!</article>

                <h5>First Qualifier</h5><p>12/6/2014</p>
            <article>For our first Regional qualifier of the season, QUADX and all the ViperBots teams had an amazing competition! Despite the fact that we had to get up at 4 in the morning to drive all the way to San Antonio, we were super excited for the competition, rocking both judging and our qualification matches. Throughout qualifiers, we experienced some minor pulley issues, but had a high score of 392 points. Additionally, we drove around our "trollbot", which loaded with our gyro stabilization code, to connect other teams with our code via GitHub. We finished 1st in qualifiers, and chose 4546 SnakeByte and 9036 from Reagan Robotics as our alliance partners, and were first pitted against the Shambots during semi's. Finals ended up being ViperBots vs. Viperbots, with our alliance beating 4545 Ouroboros, 6209 Venom and Control F8. As for awards, we were nominated for every single award except for Motivate, and also got 3rd place Inspire. With 4546 winning Inspire, 6209 winning Think, and 4545 winning Innovate, all ViperBot teams in attendance have advanced to the Regionals competition! Congratulations to all ViperBot teams, and to all those in attendance!</article>
