                <article>Game release today! After team bonding activities with 20 other central texas teams, we finally know this season’s game…. and we have to say, somebody better “rescue” us from our shock! This is definitely the hardest game yet, especially because we are half a rookie team this year. We are nonetheless super excited! This game is also the most interesting, and it will be interesting to see how teams get up the mountain. We spent about 3 hours discussing as a team how we would compete, but we could only brainstorm for so long. Instead, we went off to the yacht club to enjoy the beautiful weather while it lasts, and let us get a grasp on this crazy new game. Our second discovery of the day is the foreign exchange student we gained as a team member. Beatriz is from Sao Paulo is is super interested in Robotics, so she’ll be a great addition to the team!

                <p>3/12/15-3/14/15</p>
                <article>The first day of Super Regionals began with us getting out of 3 whole days of schoo, right before spring break- gotta love robotics. ;) As we waited for the bus, we packed up and did some final rounds of driver practice and judging. When we got to the Convention Center in San Antonio that afternoon, we had to unpack and immediately run off to judging- which of course went great! When we had finished judging and setting up the pits, we continued the tradition of heading to Luciano's, our favorite Italian restaurant on the Riverwalk, for dinner. The next day, Thursday, was the start of Qualifications. We started off strong, scoring 717 in our first round! By the end of the day, we were ranked 1st. Friday after Qualifications, we were bumped down to 2nd, just behind 4997 Masquarade. We ended up recreating last year's Worlds Team with Masquarade and 4211 The Bombers! With such an awesome alliance, we scored a 783, 2 points from the World Record, and made it to the Event Finals It was really close, but The Blue Crew Two and Neutrinos ended up beating us. Either way, we were super pumped to have qualified for the World Championship in St. Louis! Not only that, but our sister team, 6210 Stryke, received the Control Award and will be going to Worlds as well! We're so happy for them and for all the teams that qualified, and we're also super proud of the perfomance of all the other teams there, especially our other sister ViperBot team 4545 Ouroboros. Congrats to everybody, and see you in St. Louis!</article>
