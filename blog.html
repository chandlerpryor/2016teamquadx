                <h5>Vandegrift Double Qualifier</h5>
                <p>1/30/2016</p>
                <article>Today was our second qualifier! While we didn’t have to travel far, it was still a pain to get up super early to get to the school in time. And we didn’t even have to set up last night… shout out to the Viperbots who were at Vandegrift until 1AM! We would never survive that kind of night.
                    <br>
                    <br> Anyways, during the day we did pretty great, even though we were disconnecting every other match- a problem we couldn’t even reproduce after the matches, so we have no clue what’s going on. Despite these issues, we were able to produce the highest score in Texas- a 286 with Saber Robotics! That’s not saying much considering the world record is in the high 400s, but we’re pretty proud, considering we won the last qualifier with a score of 38…. Gotta love faulty lift systems. This time, we won the whole tournament with a score of 270, and that’s with Saber experiencing technical difficulties with their own lift. We also won the PTC Design Award for our awesome robot, something that seems to be happening a lot recently. ;)
                    <br>
                    <br>After 12 hours straight of robots, we went out to dinner as a team (+Brendo from 6209) to our new Mexican food place where we ate ourselves sick, were probably a little too rambunctious, and had a ton of fun! We of course went home to crash afterwards, and to enjoy our 3 days off. 2 of our members, Eddie and Jules, will be going off to NASA this week where they get to have a ton of fun, while the rest of us are back in Austin working on getting autonomous up to par. We’ve got a lot of work to do before Regionals, but this weekend was a great dry run to see what we need to do. article>

                <p>11/13/2015</p>
                <article>The past couple of days, we got a head start on our community outreach for the year. On Sunday available team members visited a local Barnes and Noble to participate in the STEM Fair from 1-4pm. We brought our World winning robot and our current robot to show off and drive around. We helped to promote the idea of FTC and FIRST throughout the community. Many observers were thrilled to hear about past accomplishments and future aspirations as well as the strides we have taken to build up STEM in our school. On Tuesday, some team members went to Grandview Hills Elementary, a feeder school for Vandegrift, to promote STEM and ViperBots, at their annual STEM Fair. We explained last years and this years game, demonstrating with last years robot and our mars-rover prototype. Since our new robot is under major redesign, we were unable to bring it. </article>

                <h5>Central Texas Scrimmage</h5>
                <p>11/7/2015</p>
                <article>The scrimmage is something us ViperBots look forward to and are proud of each year. It is a time to show off our designs and competitive ability to other Central Texas teams, as well as focus on working through the game with alliance partners and teaching rookie teams the spirit of competition. This year’s scrimmage was just like any other; we were assigned teams to compete and align with, and some matches were won and some were lost. We usually learn a thing or two during the competition as well; which strategies are most effective and how we can better design the robot to effectively score the most points possible. We scored a few points here and there but object manipulation with the balls and blocks was an issue as well as lift movement and driving over debsris in the field. We had problems with wires disconnecting and losing wifi in the arena. The difficult, new control system this year mixed with the challenging game, creates an exponentially more demanding task to accomplish. After the event on Saturday, the team realized that the robot had many flaws, possibly more flaws than could actually be fixed. The solution? Design a completely new robot. And that is what we did. Lucky for QUAD X, the past two games, which we have competed at in the Worlds level, required balls and blocks. We determined that foam worked best for the manipulation of both. Driver practice is a must as well so that during the competition, we can increase our speed and agility to score more points. For the amount of time we have had in the season thus far, our performance was not bad, but it can always be better. Our next competition is at Four Points Middle School on December 5th, and we hope to see everyone there competing with excellent robots!</article>

                <p>9/26/2015</p>
                <article>The first build day of the season is one of the craziest… and this year was no exception. We spent 8 hours in the Robot Room, working on our base and drive system, modelled off the mars rover. We made a ton of progress, and will hopefully be able to begin testing this week. In the afternoon, we hosted a workshop on programming with the new control system and how to use GitHub to access the ftc_app, which Josh skillfully lead. All in all, it was a great build day to kick off the season. </article>

                <article>Game release today! After team bonding activities with 20 other central texas teams, we finally know this season’s game…. and we have to say, somebody better “rescue” us from our shock! This is definitely the hardest game yet, especially because we are half a rookie team this year. We are nonetheless super excited! This game is also the most interesting, and it will be interesting to see how teams get up the mountain. We spent about 3 hours discussing as a team how we would compete, but we could only brainstorm for so long. Instead, we went off to the yacht club to enjoy the beautiful weather while it lasts, and let us get a grasp on this crazy new game. Our second discovery of the day is the foreign exchange student we gained as a team member. Beatriz is from Sao Paulo is is super interested in Robotics, so she’ll be a great addition to the team!

                <p>3/12/15-3/14/15</p>
                <article>The first day of Super Regionals began with us getting out of 3 whole days of schoo, right before spring break- gotta love robotics. ;) As we waited for the bus, we packed up and did some final rounds of driver practice and judging. When we got to the Convention Center in San Antonio that afternoon, we had to unpack and immediately run off to judging- which of course went great! When we had finished judging and setting up the pits, we continued the tradition of heading to Luciano's, our favorite Italian restaurant on the Riverwalk, for dinner. The next day, Thursday, was the start of Qualifications. We started off strong, scoring 717 in our first round! By the end of the day, we were ranked 1st. Friday after Qualifications, we were bumped down to 2nd, just behind 4997 Masquarade. We ended up recreating last year's Worlds Team with Masquarade and 4211 The Bombers! With such an awesome alliance, we scored a 783, 2 points from the World Record, and made it to the Event Finals It was really close, but The Blue Crew Two and Neutrinos ended up beating us. Either way, we were super pumped to have qualified for the World Championship in St. Louis! Not only that, but our sister team, 6210 Stryke, received the Control Award and will be going to Worlds as well! We're so happy for them and for all the teams that qualified, and we're also super proud of the perfomance of all the other teams there, especially our other sister ViperBot team 4545 Ouroboros. Congrats to everybody, and see you in St. Louis!</article>

                <h5>Regionals Weekend</h5>
                <p>2/21/2015</p>
                <article>Our Regionals Championship started off great by getting out of school on Friday to drive down to San Antonio for setup, inspections, and judging. We arrived with a good 4 hours to set up before judging, and by 7 o'clock we had finished up for the night! If only getting food after that had been as easy as preparing for competition... funnily enough, none of the restaurants in town were too excited to feed 60 hungry teenagers. Nevertheless, we finally were fed and well(ish) rested for competition the next day. We started Saturday off great by scoring a 533 with our alliance partner, keeping within the 500-600's all of qualifications. We ended up undefeated and 2nd due to RP points, picking High PHidelity and Orobourus as partners. We made it to what we called "Murphy's Finals" because everything that could go wrong, did. During the first match, we disconected and despooled one of our pulleys in the process. We had to call a timeout, and our oponents (Dark Horse, Chrome, and Philobots) showed amazing gracious professionalism by using their timeout as well. The next two rounds, Chrome lost their battery, one of Dark Horse's driver cut his hand open, and our wiring got messed up from our time disconnected earlier. We emerged from probably the most eventful Division Finals ever victorious, and went up against Stryke and the Elemonators in the Event Finals. We won the event, throughout having 5 matches over 700 points! We were super close to setting a new world record, but were really proud of our success. Afterwards, during awards, we watched an amazing performance of the interpreter for the Texas School for the Deaf sign out It's All About That Bass, which was entertaining to watch. We got 2nd Place Inspire, and our very own Lizzy Patterson was nominated as a semi-finalist for the Dean's List Award! At the end of the day, we had qualified for Super Regionals, along with sister teams Stryke and Orobourus. We're sad to see Viperbots Big Fang Fury, Snakebyte, and Venoms' seasons end, but are super excited for the 3 teams that qualified, and can't wait to see everybody at Super Regionals in 3 weeks!</article>

                <h5>Special Olympics and Team Bonding</h5>
                <p>2/7/2015</p>
                <article>This weekend, QUADX continued the tradition of volunteering at the Texas Special Olympics (SOTX). For a couple hours, we helped people with special needs in their bowling competition, making sure they got up to bowl their turn and cheering them on. After two great games, the bowlers were done and had their awards ceremony. We always love volunteering at the Special Olympics, because everyone has a ton of fun- the bowlers and the volunteers alike! Once the event was over, we headed out to Hopdoddy's, probably the best burger place in town. We had to wait a whole hour in line for these amazing burgers, but we spent it all hanging out and talking. After we'd died and gone to heaven eaten, we all headed over to Tyler's house for some more team bonding. We hung out, and watched one of the best movies ever- Monty Python and the Holy Grail. With competition coming up soon, it was really nice to spend a day volunteering and just relaxing as a team and as a group of friends!</article>

                <h5>Harlandale Double Qualifier</h5>
                <p>1/31/2015</p>
                <article>Our second qualifier of the season, we were back out in San Antonio at Harlandale High School. Having already qualified, we saw this as a great opportunity to test out our new robot and make some new friends! It turns out we would have plenty of time to do so, as the high school we were out experienced power outages for the first 3 hours. During that time, we hung out with other FTC teams, and even got to explain how we built the robot to many FLL teams that were competiting this weekend as well. When Qualifications began, we found some minor issues with our robot, but we were happy for them to arise- now we know what to fix before Regionals. We were 1st Captain, and chose the Shambots and Blackout Enigma as our alliance partners. With such a great alliance, we won the competition! We also won the Think Award and 2nd Place Inspire, and within the other division, our sister team 6210 Viperbots Stryke won 1st Place Inspire and Winning Alliance 1st pick, thus qualifying for Regionals! We're super proud of both our accomplishments and those of all the teams that were there. Hope to see everyone at Regionals!</article>

                <h5>First Qualifier</h5>
                <p>12/6/2014</p>
                <article>For our first Regional qualifier of the season, QUADX and all the ViperBots teams had an amazing competition! Despite the fact that we had to get up at 4 in the morning to drive all the way to San Antonio, we were super excited for the competition, rocking both judging and our qualification matches. Throughout qualifiers, we experienced some minor pulley issues, but had a high score of 392 points. Additionally, we drove around our "trollbot", which loaded with our gyro stabilization code, to connect other teams with our code via GitHub. We finished 1st in qualifiers, and chose 4546 SnakeByte and 9036 from Reagan Robotics as our alliance partners, and were first pitted against the Shambots during semi's. Finals ended up being ViperBots vs. Viperbots, with our alliance beating 4545 Ouroboros, 6209 Venom and Control F8. As for awards, we were nominated for every single award except for Motivate, and also got 3rd place Inspire. With 4546 winning Inspire, 6209 winning Think, and 4545 winning Innovate, all ViperBot teams in attendance have advanced to the Regionals competition! Congratulations to all ViperBot teams, and to all those in attendance!</article>
